kluctl is the missing glue that puts together your (and any third-party) deployments into one large declarative
Kubernetes deployment, while making it fully manageable (deploy, diff, prune, delete, ...) via one unified command
line interface.

This repository contains examples for external cluster configurations. Please take a look at 
[kluctl-examples](https://github.com/kluctl/kluctl-examples) for further information.
